# CSMSL
An in-house fork of Derek Bailey's C# Mass Spectrometry Library. Current version needs to be built on the .NET framework.

### Changes
* Updated to work with Thermo's newer RawFileReader instead of MsFileReader.
* Added Transcriptomics package for in-silico modeling of transcripts.
* Added Glycomics package for in-silico modeling of glycans (August 8th, 2023; linear glycans only).

# TODOs
* Swap from .NET Framework to .NET core libraries.
* Add support for branched glycans.
